A compilation of services that I have come to use for various tasks, both cloud based and server related. In addition to services/frameworks that I might want to use in the future


## Inbound mail processing
1. [Mailgun](http://mailgun.com)

## Load Testing
1. [Flood.io](https://flood.io/)
1. [Siege](http://www.joedog.org/siege-home/)
1. [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
1. [Gatling](http://gatling-tool.org/)

## Application Monitoring
1. [Newrelic](http://newrelic.com)

## Databases
1. [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com) Very fast and easily scales horrizontally.
1. [Mogodb](http://mongodb.com) Master/Slave replication, lots of articles out there as to why you shouldn't use it. You decide.

## Log aggregation

### Cloud-based
1. [Rollbar](http://www.rollbar.com) Focuses primarily on error logs, but can also agregate other messaging levels too.
1. [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io/) Boasts high throughput with a sparkly UI
1. [Loggly](http://loggly.com) Not the biggest fan of this service, UI and message search is slow.

### Self managed
1. [Logstash](http://logstash.net/) Combine with the latest version of kibana and you really got something here

## Search
1. [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org) I'm not sure what I would do without it
